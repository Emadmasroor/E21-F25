E21 has four lab sections: Section 1 (Mondays), Section 2 (Thursdays), Section 3 (Mondays), and Section 4 (Thursdays). If you are not listed in one of the lab sections below, it is because you are not registered for a lab section.  Please add the E21 lab to your schedule, and then you will be placed in a section corresponding to the day your lab meets.
