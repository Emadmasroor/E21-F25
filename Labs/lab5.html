         **E21 Lab 5: Benchmarking optimizers for image approximation**
               **[ENGR 21 - Fall 2025](../index.html#lab5)**
             **November 10-20, 2025**
             **Due on Moodle two weeks from your lab meeting**

In this lab, you will investigate the effectiveness of several optimization techniques in the application of lossy image compression.


(#) Objectives

  * Understand the differences between general function minimization and
    nonlinear least squares.
    
  * Distinguish between gradient-free and gradient-based optimizers.
  
  * Learn how continous signals may be approximated by sums of
    nonlinear basis functions.

  * Gain experience with more advanced Python features including format
    strings and inner functions.

(##) Boot Up the Lab Computers

Optimization can be a computationally expensive process. For this lab, we have observed dramatically different runtimes on different machines. For that reason, I **strongly** recommend you use the console PCs in the lab since that is the only way I can guarantee you will have reasonable runtimes.  Sign in with your Swarthmore credentials right away because it takes Windows a few minutes to set up the first time you login.  Then, open a command terminal and install the dependencies using the following command below.

~~~bash
py -m pip install scipy matplotlib PyQt5
~~~


(##) Pair Programming

We will continue using [driver/navigator pair programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html#DriverAndNavigator). As a reminder, one team member---the driver---uses the keyboard and mouse to write code, run code, test code, etc. The other team member---the navigator---reviews the code the driver writes, checks for errors in syntax or logic, and thinks ahead about the strategic goals and next steps of the programming task. The driver and navigator are in constant communication, thinking aloud and narrating the code as it is written, even though they have two different roles to focus on. Every so often, the driver and navigator switch roles.

[Pair programming is used in software development for its benefits](https://www.datadoghq.com/knowledge-center/pair-programming/) of producing higher quality and more organized code as well as facilitating knowledge transfer between programmers. Think of the analogy of actually driving a car where the driver is reacting to immediate tasks and the navigator is reading the map to alert the driver of upcoming tasks. I will remind you **every 20 minutes** to switch drivers.  Resist the temptation to type if you are not the driver.  Communicating about what a program does---both explaining it and understanding someone's explanation---is an important skill that I want you to practice.

# Background

Starter code for this lab is available [here](lab5.zip).

For this project, we will approximate a grayscale image using a sum of
$k$ 2D
[Gaussian functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function#Two-dimensional_Gaussian_function).
Each Gaussian function has six parameters influencing its shape/size
(2 parameters), location (2 parameters), rotation (1 parameter), and
amplitude (1 parameter). Therefore, the overall image may be
approximated by $6k$ numbers.

  ![Figure [gfunc]: Illustration showing Gaussian function parameters](images/lab5_gauss_func.png style="width: 75%" alt="A 2d Gaussian function is plotted on the XY plane.  Parameters SU, SV, XC, YC, and theta are labeled.")

!!! Tip
    ***Note:*** We are using Gaussian functions as
    [*basis functions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_function). The
    term gets thrown around a bunch in mathematics and Engineering,
    but it really boils down to a set of functions that can
    be linearly combined (i.e. added together in a weighted sum) to
    create a new function with a different shape.
    
    In many applications, the shapes of the functions are fixed and
    pre-determined ahead of time; in our application here, we are
    refining the shapes of the functions and the weights in parallel.

Contrast this to the "traditional" method of representing a $w$-by-$h$
image as a list of pixel intensities of length $wh$ – if our Gaussian
functions approximate the image well, and if $6k \ll wh$, we have
effectively compressed the image by representing it with a much
smaller list of numbers.

  ![Figure [starter]: detail of Mona Lisa being approximated by a sum of Gaussian functions](images/lab5_monalisa_approx.png style="width: 75%" alt="Four images are shown in a two by two grid.  Clockwise from top left: \(1\) the original image of Mona Lisa's eye, \(2\) a blurry approximation of Mona Lisa's eye as the sum of 10 Gaussians, \(3\) 10 red and blue ellipses representing the Gaussians superimposed on the approximation image, \(4\) a plot of the pixel-by-pixel error between the approximation and the original.  The sum of squared error is 4.89.")

Since the reconstructed image is not perfectly equivalent to the
target (input) image, this compression scheme is said to be *lossy*.

!!! Warning
    ***Disclaimer:*** The
    [PNG image format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics)
    allows for both lossless and lossy compression, and
    [JPEG compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) is designed
    exclusively for lossy compression; however, neither one uses an
    approach quite like the one we are taking in this lab. Gaussian functions
    are fun to play with but are *wildly* impractical compared with more sophisticated
    compression schemes.

## Problem setup and notation

We have already defined $k$ to be the number of 2D Gaussian functions
used to approximate an image, and defined the image dimensions as $h$
rows by $w$ columns.

Let $n = wh$ be the total number of pixels in the image. Then we can enumerate
the $i^\text{th}$ pixel location as $(x_i, y_i)$ where $i \in \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$.

Now define the vector $\mathbf{q}$ to be the concatenation of $k$ individual Gaussian function parameter vectors:

$$\mathbf{q} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{q}_1 \\ \mathbf{q}_2 \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{q}_k \end{array} \right].$$

Each individual parameter vector $\mathbf{q}_j$ has length 6, hence, $\mathbf{q}$ has total length $6k$.

Then to evaluate the *reconstructed image*, which we denote as $I$, at pixel $(x_i, y_i)$, we
can define it as the sum of $k$ Gaussian functions evaluated at that
pixel location:

$$I(\mathbf{q}, x_i, y_i) = \sum_{j=1}^k g(\mathbf{q}_j, x_i, y_i),$$

where $g(\mathbf{q}_j, x_i, y_i)$ evaluates the $j^\text{th}$ Gaussian function at the $i^\text{th}$ pixel location.

The *residual image* $R$ is the image determined by the difference of the target image $T$ with the reconstructed image *I*:

$$R(\mathbf{q}, x_i, y_i) = T(x_i, y_i) - I(\mathbf{q}, x_i, y_i).$$

We can also consider the residual as a vector-valued function $\mathbf{r}(\mathbf{q})$ whose elements are pixels in the residual image:

$$\mathbf{r}(\mathbf{q}) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} R(\mathbf{q}, x_1, y_1) \\ R(\mathbf{q}, x_2, y_2) \\ \vdots \\ R(\mathbf{q}, x_n, y_n) \end{array}\right].$$

We would like to minimize the *objective function* which we will denote as $f(\mathbf{q})$:

$$f(\mathbf{q}) = \| \mathbf{r}(\mathbf{q}) \|^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n R(\mathbf{q}, x_i, y_i)^2 $$

Note we can refer to the objective function value as the sum of squared errors, or SSE for short.

## Formalizations and Python implementations

[General multivariate optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem) minimizes a function $f:
\mathbb{R}^m \mapsto \mathbb{R}$. You can accomplish this in `scipy`
using the function
[`scipy.optimize.minimize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html). This
particular function implements both gradient-free methods such as [Powell's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell%27s_method) and the [Nelder-Mead method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method), but also gradient-based methods such as the [Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno aka BFGS algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Goldfarb%E2%80%93Shanno_algorithm).

A special case of general optimization is
[non-linear least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_least_squares),
where we can specify that $f(\mathbf{q}) = \| \mathbf{r} ( \mathbf{q}
) \|^2$ for some non-linear function $\mathbf{r}: \mathbb{R}^m \mapsto
\mathbb{R}^n$.  This is frequently the case in approximation problems
where we want to minimize the sum of squared errors between a target
signal and a reconstructed signal, as in our image optimization problem.
In Python we can use 
[`scipy.optimize.least_squares`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html), which
implements multiple methods including [Levenberg-Marquardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm) and other
[trust region methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_region).

Note that every non-linear least squares problem can be solved as a
general optimization problem, but not every optimization problem is a
non-linear least squares problem.

## Example: reconstructing an RLC circuit impulse response

The `fit_voltage.py` example in the starter code shows how to use both 
[`scipy.optimize.minimize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html) 
and
[`scipy.optimize.least_squares`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html) 
to reconstruct a signal from a sum of nonlinear basis functions, as shown in the figure below:

   ![Figure [example1d]: Plot from `fit_voltage.py` example](images/lab5_rlc_approx.png style="width: 75%" alt="Measurements of voltage versus time are shown as black dots on a scatter plot.  Three curves are shown as function approximations: \(1\) an initial guess as a dotted green line that is far off from the target data, a function using minimize \(err=1.83, nfev=321\) as a solid teal line that approximates the data well, and a function using least squares \(err=1.83, nfev=13\) as a dashed blue line that approximates the data well.")

The plot shows some noisy sampled data (black dots) that could come from an oscilloscope measuring the impulse response of
an overdamped [RLC circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RLC_circuit). Theory tells us that the voltage measured by the scope
can be modeled as

   $$V(t) = A_1 \exp( s_1 \, t ) + A_2 \exp( s_2 \, t), $$
   
where $s_1$ and $s_2$ are time constant that depend on the resistance, capacitance, and inductance of the circuit, and
where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are scale factors that depend on the initial voltage and current at $t = 0$.

Starting from a poor initial guess of the four parameters $\mathbf{q}
= (A_1, A_2, s_1, s_2)$, we can use the optimization functions to find
the best-fit estimates that minimize the sum of squared differences
between the black points and the reconstructed curve.

Note that both functions find solutions of equal quality, but the
non-linear least squares formulation of the problem appears to be more
efficient than the general minimization in terms of number of
objective function evaluations.

# Lab Exercises

## Exercise 1: discussion questions

Before you begin coding, look over and run the `fit_voltage.py` and
`starter.py` scripts, then answer these questions. Cite any sources
you consult to find the answers.

   * **Q1)** In `fit_voltage.py`, what is the purpose of the strings that
     start with `f` and which contain curly braces? For example, one
     is on the following line taken from that program:
   
     ~~~ Python
     ax.plot(t, v_min, 'c-', label=f'minimize (err={f_min:.3g}, nfev={n_min})')
     ~~~

   * **Q2)** What are *inner functions* in Python? What functions in
     `fit_voltage.py` are inner functions, and what benefit do they
     provide in this program?

!!! Tip
    ***Hint:*** Consider what happens if you try to move the definition
    of the `recons` function above the `main` function.
    
  * **Q3)** What is the purpose of `numpy.meshgrid` and why is it being used
    in `starter.py`? How might it be better than writing a `for` loop
    over each $(x_i, y_i)$ pixel location?
  
## Exercise 2: Image approximation

Before you begin, open up the `starter.py` file and save it as a new
file `ex2.py`.

Start by commenting out the line that loads parameters from
`example_params.txt` and uncommenting the line below it to generate
randomized parameters. Next, use an optimizer to improve the objective
function value for the randomized parameters. I suggest using
`scipy.optimize.minimize` with the additional arguments
`method='Powell'` and `options=dict(maxfev=10000)`.

Once you have Powell's method working, modify your program to compare
that approach with the `'L-BFGS-B'` method of
`scipy.optimize.minimize` and also with the `'trf'` method of
`scipy.optimize.least_squares`. Between the methods, you should compare the value of the objective function, the time it takes to solve the optimization, and the subjective quality of the image approximation. For each method, use the 
additional arguments specified in this table:

  Function         | Parameters 
  -----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------
   `minimize`      | `method='Powell', options=dict(maxfev=10000)`
   `minimize`      | `method='L-BFGS-B', jac='2-point', options=dict(maxfun=10000)`
   `least_squares` | `method='trf', max_nfev=10000`

!!! Warning
    Don't forget to pass the appropriate function (`objective` or `err_vec`) to 
    each optimizer depending whether you are doing general minimization or non-linear least squares.

You can time your code's execution time with `time.perf_counter()` like the example below.

~~~Python
start_time = time.perf_counter()
# long slow optimization routine
elapsed_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time
~~~

Have your program do five trials total for each of the three optimizers
using $k=8, 16,$ and $32$ basis functions.  This will require solving a
total of $5 \times 3 \times 3 = 45$ optimization problems.  You
should set this up in a triply nested `for` loop similar to the
program structure outlined below.  During the loop, you should save the appropriate data to generate the plots and images required for **Q4** and **Q5** below.  Also, I recommend include periodic and informative print statements so you can monitor the status of your script while it is running.

~~~ Python
# pre-allocate data structures for saving optimized parameters, objective function values, runtimes, mininum costs, etc.

for k in [8, 16, 32]:

  for method in ['Powell', 'L-BFGS-B', 'trf']:
  
    for trial in range(5):
    
       # generate a randomized initial parameter vector of length 6k
       
       # optimize it using the current method

       # store the runtime of the optimization to compute mean and variance later
       
       # store the objective function value to compute mean and variance later
       
       # if this is the best trial for the current (k, method) pair,
       # then save the parameter vector and the image 
       
    # compute the mean and standard deviation of the
    # objective function values and runtimes for this (k, method)
    # pair and save them for plotting
    
# plot all of the results on two bar charts, one for objective function values and the other for runtimes
~~~

!!! Warning
    **I strongly suggest that you not aim to run all 45 trials
    until you are 100% certain your code works for all three
    kinds of optimizers!** Since this code takes a decent amount
    of time to run, it would be a shame to have to restart it 
    too many times. One way to develop more quickly would
    be to temporarily use two, rather than five trials per `(k, method)` pair.
    Once you are able to run through two trials per pair, you can
    crank the number of trials up to five and restart your code
    with confidence.
    
    By the same token, feel free to temporarily change the `[8, 16, 32]`
    to just `[8]` while you're getting started.
    
!!! Tip
    Don't forget that [**`enumerate`**](lab2.html#toc1.4.2) exists. You can update the
    the outermost two **`for`** loops to use it if you need to 
    know e.g. both which **`k`** value you are using as well
    as the index of the current **`k`** value.
    
Generate a grouped bar chart (example code
[here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/barchart.html))
of the average objective function value for each ($k$, method)
combination. Use different colors for each different optimization
method, and group the methods by $k$ value. Also add error bars
(example code
[here](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/python-matplotlib-error-bars.html))
based on the standard deviations you compute.

(###) Questions

 * **Q4)** Save your bar charts using code similar to 

   ~~~ Python
   plt.savefig('barchart.png', dpi=300)
   ~~~
   
   and include it in your PDF writeup.  Also, include in your submission the nine best parameters
   vectors for each ($k$, method) combination saved as text files whose
   filenames are determined by this code:

   ~~~ Python
   param_filename = f'params_{k}_{method.lower()}.txt'
   ~~~
   for example `params_8_powell.txt` or `params_32_trf.txt`.
   
 * **Q5)** Include a 3x3 table in your writeup displaying the
   best optimized image for each ($k$, method) combination.

## Exercise 3: Going further

Go further by choosing ***just one of*** the following activities:

  * Create a new file `sinusoid.py` to replace the six-parameter
    Gaussian basis function with a four-parameter sinusoid.

    The four parameters of a single sinusoid function are denoted $w, u, v,$ and $c$, and
    the basis function can be evaluated at a single pixel location by using the formula

    $$ s(w, u, v, c, x_i, y_i) = w \sin( u \, x_i + v \, y_i + c).$$

    Reasonable bounds for each parameter are as follows:

    $$\begin{align*}
      w, u, v & \in [ -0.1, 0.1 ] \\
      c & \in [ -32, 32 ]
    \end{align*}$$

    Use only the method you identified as the best-performing in Task
    1, and increase the number of basis functions to keep the total
    number of parameters the same (e.g. loop over `k in [12, 24, 48]`).
    
    In your PDF writeup, compare and contrast your best result from
    the sinusoidal basis function with that of the Gaussian
    function. Make sure to include output images. Based
    on your comparison, is it easier or harder to for the optimizer to
    approximate with sinusoids rather than Gaussian functions?
    
  * Create a new file `color.py` that uses Gaussian functions to
    approximate a $32 \times 32$ RGB color image of your choosing.
    One good way to do this would be to replace the single Gaussian
    amplitude parameter with a vector of 3 parameters, for a total of
    8 parameters per basis function. Good images to fit are ones that
    don't have too many shapes/details, e.g. an eye is better than an
    entire face.
    
    In your PDF writeup, detail the steps you and your partner took to
    modify the starter code to deal with color images, and comment on
    your results. Make sure to include representative image inputs and
    outputs.
    
!!! Warning
    You will need to adjust the way that images are loaded, 
    displayed, and saved if you choose this task. See me if
    you need help.
    
    
  * In your PDF writeup, document one of the methods available when
    calling `scipy.optimize.minimize` or
    `scipy.optimize.least_squares`. Who invented it? What was their
    academic and/or professional background? What are its advantages
    and trade-offs when comparing with other optimization methods?
    Cite any sources you refer to.
    
  * Find another way to explore the topic of signal reconstruction
    with non-linear basis functions (but consult me before you choose
    a task).

If you write any code for this task, make sure it is included in your
PDF writeup. Similarly, if you generate any images or graphs, include
them in your writeup.

# Deliverables

By two weeks from today's lab, submit the following on Moodle:

  * Your completed `ex2.py` file.
  
  * Parameters of best-fitting images from exercise 2 that were
    generated by your `ex2.py` file.
  
  * Any Python code you wrote for exercise 3.

  * A PDF writeup using the provided template with your names, the assignment name, answers to 
    all questions **Q1**-**Q5** above as well as **Q6**-**Q10** below:

   * **Q6)** What problems did you run into when completing the tasks,
     and how did you work together to overcome them? How was your experience with pair programming this time around?

   * **Q7)** In `fit_voltage.py`, imagine transforming a set of parameters by
     swapping the values of $A_1$ and $A_2$, and also swapping the
     values of $s_1$ and $s_2$. That is, the new parameters have the
     same values, just in a different order. Would this affect the
     objective function value? What does your answer imply about the
     existence of

     the objective function landscape?
      
   * **Q8)** In Exercise 2, how did the three methods compare in their
     effectiveness at solving the problem? Why do you think you saw
     the performance differences you did? Did the results agree or
     disagree with the pattern established in `fit_voltage.py`? Can you see any possible advantages
     of using the method or methods that were not the most effective at 
     reducing error?
     
   * **Q9)** Comment on your efforts for exercise 3 (see
     [section 2.3](#toc2.3) for detailed prompts). Include
