| Lab           | 15%     |
| Final Project | 15%     |

### Lectures

Lectures for this class will be in person. They will not be recorded, and remote participation is not possible. You are expected to attend all lectures unless you have received an exception from the Instructor.

Since this is a computer-based class, you are **required** to bring a laptop computer. If this causes you some material hardship, please contact the Instructor. There are charging stations in Singer 033, but you are encouraged to bring a fully-charged computer to avoid disruptions to the class.

### Homework

Homework will be assigned approximately every week, and will typically be due by midnight on the Tuesday following the week in which it was assigned. You can generally expect HW n to cover the material from week $n$, and to be due in week n+1. Typically, homework will be submitted on Moodle using Gradescope. 

Most homework assignments will have a written component as well as a programming component.

### Tests

The purpose of holding six tests instead of one or two midterms is so that you have low-stakes opportunities to demonstrate your mastery of the course material at regular intervals. In general, you can expect these tests to be independent of each other, as opposed to being cumulative. 

These tests will be held on Thursdays during the first half of class time (typically for 20 to 25 minutes), and will typically be closed-book, closed-notes and closed-computer. The tests will usually be incremental rather than cumulative, and will only cover the material from approximately two weeks prior to each test. Typically, Test n will cover the material from week 2n and week 2n, and will be held on week 2n+1; for example, test 1 will cover weeks 1 and 2 and will be held on the Thursday of week 3; test 2 will cover weeks 3 and 4 and will be held on the Thursday of week 5, etc.

### Labs
Labs will be held on Mondays or Thursdays from 1:15 to 4:00. You should be signed up for either Monday (CRN 19688) or Thursday (CRN 19689).

### Final Project
In lieu of a final exam, you will have a final project, aka 'Lab 6'. There will be dedicated class time to work on your final project in the last two weeks of class. 

# Ed Stem
We will use the [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/85676/) platform for course communication. While you are still welcome to email the instructor directly with questions you may have, please use Ed Discussion as a first step when you have a question about the course; you are encouraged to answer each other's questions (as long as you are not directly providing solutions to homework problems or lab assignments). The Instructors as well as Wizards will monitor Ed Discussion and answer questions.

# Policies

The college's policies on [Academic Misconduct](https://www.swarthmore.edu/student-handbook/academic-policies#academic_misconduct) apply to this class.

## Assessment and Grades

In this class, you will have six regularly-spaced [tests](#tests) instead of one or two midterms. Reflecting the hands-on nature of the content of E21, a large proportion of the grade depends on your performance in labs and the final project (30%). There is no final exam for this course, and your final project plays the role of a 'final'. The full breakdown of how your grade will be calculated is shown in the following table.

The participation grade will primarily be determined based on attendance.

The grade thresholds are shown below. The Instructor, in consultation with the Lab Instructor, reserves the right to revise these numbers downward, but will not revise these numbers upward.

| To get a grade of | You must score at least |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| A-                | 90                      |
| B-                | 80                      |
| C-                | 70                      |
| D-                | 60                      |

A score of 60 out of 100 is the minimum passing grade for this course. 

The class will not be 'curved'. The instructor's interpretation of letter grades is the following: an A is an excellent grade; a B is a good grade, and a C is an acceptable grade. A D reflects a barely passing grade, and a score less than 60 is a failing grade. 

## Policy on AI Tools

- You are not prohibited from using Large Language Model (LLM) based tools such as ChatGPT, Google NotebookLM, Gemini, etc. to help you study for this course.
- You are prohibited from using Large Language Models to produce anything that you turn in for this class, including code or prose/text.

Violations of this policy will be treated as cases of academic misconduct.

The reliance on AI tools to produce work that you should know how to do yourself puts you at a serious disadvantage compared to your peers who learned the same material without the help of these tools. If you only know how to solve a problem by `asking an AI to do it', you have not learned what you were supposed to learn.

## Collaboration and Attribution

- Feel free to collaborate with your classmates on homework; however, you must submit your own work. Duplicating others’ assignments verbatim (especially code!) is prohibited.
- If you do discuss homework with your classmates, we expect you to disclose any such collaboration clearly in your submitted work. Err on the side of caution – it’s the best way to avoid awkward conversations about suspicious similarities between assignments.
- Cite any external sources used, including the textbook, internet, discussions with other professors, etc.

## Late Work

- In general, late assignments will not be graded. However:
- You may ask for (and automatically receive) a one-week extension on deadlines for homework and lab assignments, no questions asked, once each during the semester. Please indicate in your email that you are using your ‘one free extension’ when you do so. Your ‘free extension’ applies once to homework assignments and once to lab assignments.
- If you have extenuating circumstances and would like to request an extension on a deadline, please reach out via email to the instructor at least 24 hours before the deadline. Such a request may be granted on a case-by-case basis and will typically incur a severe penalty of 25% per day.

Please note that, because of the fast-paced nature of this course and the interdependence of tests on homework assignments, requesting a deadline extension for homework assignments is discouraged.

## Missed Exams

If you miss a test without prior notice, it will not be rescheduled for you in fairness to other students and you will score a zero for that test. To request an alternate time under extenuating circumstances, you must write to the Instructor at least two days prior to the test, i.e., latest by the end of Tuesday for tests on Thursday. Such a request will be granted at the discretion of the Instructor.

## Accommodations

Students with disabilities or chronic medical conditions requesting accommodations, such as additional time on examinations, extensions to course deadlines, or exceptions to classroom policies, should submit an official request through the College's centralized portal for the communication of this information, known as `Accommodate'. In addition, the student should speak with the Instructor to determine the appropriate accommodations.
